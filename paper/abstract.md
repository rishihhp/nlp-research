This research paper aims to explain an empirical investigation concerning the correlation between the length of an
intents.json file and the runtime of NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) and Tensor Flow algorithms in Python,
tailored towards chatbot development. By examining the runtime efficiency based on various intents.json file sizes,
the study aims to ascertain the impact of file length on algorithm performance through the utilization of a least
squares regression line. Experimental analysis reveals a compelling linear relationship between intents.json length
and training runtime, indicative of an O (N) runtime complexity. This research provides practical implications for
developers seeking to enhance the runtime performance of chatbot systems by providing them with a baseline of
runtime for dynamic chatbot creation.
